    There is a obvious explanation as to bands are great because music is great.
    For sure my favorite thing is hearing live music. Often people relate to a
    band or a band members. I remember the year I fell in love with music. I had
    no idea just how much music would be a part of my life. Preteen boy bands
    were sweeping the nation and sometimes mischievous rumors would keep them
    popular. While I was grow into my own different music genres grew on me. I
    never realized how much music could really help someone. Music allowed me to
    finish goals, cheered me up, and helped me rant to clear my head. I know at
    that point music was a part of me and I would be creative without. I know if
    it helped me on a small level the music therapy could be life changing for
    others. Creating a search tool that makes it easy connects people with a
    live experiences to appreciate music will do wonders in other peoples life
    as well.
